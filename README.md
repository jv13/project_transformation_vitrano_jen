##Resources
* [Boilerplate](https://github.com/h5bp/html5-boilerplate/blob/master/src/css/main.css#L107-L169): The visually hidden class was taken from the GitHub repository Boilerplate to hide the section headers from being displayed.  The purpose of this is so that screen readers are able to understand the websites structure.

##Comments
* When I first read through this assignment I kept thinking about the media queries.  Instead of just adding them in I decided to go through the week 6 lecture videos again and follow along with this project.  As I was going through them I realized just how much effort and thought is put into making such a transformation.  I probably would have forgotten to remove certain elements or properties if it wasn't for that, as well as probably would have forgotten to outline the structure of the site for better screen reader readability. The videos also helped to keep me sorta on track with committing.  Once I wasn't following along or if I paused a video I found myself making too many changes that wouldn't make sense in one commit. That is something that I am striving to work on as I know myself to keep working on different sections at a time with no real rhyme or reason.
* I removed the h2 styling from the CSS since all of them were hidden.
* I kept the keyword logo the same size because I thought for branding it would not be good to resize any smaller on the lower width screens.
* I removed the padding from the left of the sidebar once the screen reached 1200px so that it would line up with the other elements on the left (example: banner image, logo).
